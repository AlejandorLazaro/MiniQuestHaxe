# MiniQuestHaxe
HaxeFlixel version of my 6+ year old Ludum 23 project 'MiniQuest'! This will be an attempt to port the project over from JS to Haxe.
## Running the project
After setting up all of HaxeFlixel (see https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/getting-started/), you can run `lime test html5 --debug` to get the game going. :)
